pitchtrack
==========

I'm just expirimenting with some technology (err, anything front end) I'm not really familiar with in here. The main idea is to make a web app for tracking baseball/softball pitches

- works with very limited internet connection
- is super simple to enter pitches. I'm imagining being able to drag a mouse across the screen for input rather than having to click several different checkboxes.


For the css, run "compass compile ~/Web/Content/Styles"
